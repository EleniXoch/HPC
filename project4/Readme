--Convolution Filter Implementation--

Project 4)

working on previous double type data and padding implementation

further optimizations including: 
	-constant memory
	-registers

-keeping time measurements for comparison of versions
-analyzing usability of each load and memory load impact on program
-commenting on program memory limits

NEW: 

Supporting bigger images:
	-tiling 
	-different kernel launches

utilizing streams:
	-parallel execution
	-profile to validate performance results
	-nvprof results
